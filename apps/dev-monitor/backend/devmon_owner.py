"""devmon_owner — the owner gate for the message and action axes.

Three layers, and only the middle one is a boundary: nginx blocks first, THIS module is the
authorization boundary, and the frontend merely displays. Every request re-checks two
things — that it came through nginx (the proxy secret, which only nginx injects) and who
the ingress says is asking (the owner header).

Fail-closed on configuration: a PARTIALLY configured message feature raises rather than
running with a hole, because "I set three of the four env vars" must not silently become
"the gate is off". Nothing configured at all is a different case — the feature is simply
not deployed and the monitor keeps serving observability.

Mutating requests are authenticated BEFORE the body is read, and are additionally checked
for same-origin, JSON content type and size.
