"""devmon_spool — a Maildir-style atomic drop spool.

Layout: $SPOOL/{tmp,new,processing,bad}

A producer publishes by writing to tmp/ with O_EXCL and then link()ing it to
new/<event_id>.json — the appearance of a name in new/ is therefore atomic, and a
half-written file can never be picked up.

The collector is ONE watcher thread. It takes ownership by rename(new -> processing),
which is what makes concurrent collectors and restarts safe: whoever wins the rename owns
the file, and everyone else sees FileNotFoundError. Then it reads defensively (O_NOFOLLOW,
fstat regular, bounded read), requires the filename to equal the payload's event_id,
validates, and ingests. Anything that fails is quarantined in bad/ and recorded in
ingest_errors — never dropped silently.

The reader assumes nothing about the producer. In the default single-box install the producer
is the same user, but the spool is also the one place an outside process can hand this service
input, so it is read as if it were hostile: symlink, FIFO, device and directory are refused, a
payload over MAX_PAYLOAD (16KB) is refused, a filename that disagrees with the payload is
refused, and nothing ever clobbers existing evidence.
