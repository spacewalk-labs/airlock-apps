"""token-freshness — the periodic half: check the provider credentials, then say so.

Run by airlock-token-freshness.service (see systemd/ and install-token-timer.sh). One
run does two things, in this order:

  1. Write the snapshot. Always, whatever the verdict — the dashboard card reads it, and
     its age is the only way a checker that stopped running is visible as staleness
     rather than as silence. This must happen even when step 2 cannot.
  2. Publish a card to the dev-monitor spool for anything that is not ok. That console
     already exists, already reaches the operator, and already coalesces one card per
     group_key per day — which is exactly the cadence a daily expiry warning wants.

Step 2 is best effort and never fails the run on its own; step 1 is the run's job.

    python3 token-freshness.py [--warn-hours N] [--stale-hours N] [--spool DIR]
                               [--snapshot PATH] [--no-spool] [--quiet]

Exit status is about the CHECK MACHINERY, not the verdict: 0 when the check ran and the
snapshot was written, 1 when it could not. An expired token is a card, not a crash —
systemd's OnFailure= is reserved for the watchdog itself dying, which is the failure
nobody would otherwise see.

What it never does: read, print or publish a token value. It only ever handles the
verdicts devmon_tokens produces, which carry timestamps and field names.
