# The hub gate ($hub_ok) is asserted ONCE, at the server level, so these locations
# inherit it and an identity that is neither the owner nor a collaborator gets the
# wrong-owner page. filebrowser binds loopback only.
#
# SCOPE. filebrowser runs with `--root /`: the tree is the filesystem, and there is
# no configured boundary to set. What bounds this is the unix account the user
# service runs as — /etc and /var/log are readable, /root is not. That is stated in
# SECURITY.md, and it is the whole reason `[paths].code_root` no longer exists: the
# key was never a designed setting, it was the argument markserv and filebrowser
# each demand, promoted into config because the installer had to write it somewhere.
#
# NOTHING IS HIDDEN. There is no ignore list and no dotfile rule. `.env` is an
# ordinary file: it lists, opens, edits and saves through the same path as any
# other. filebrowser ships a real `hideDotfiles` setting that would break that, so
# the installer pins it false rather than relying on the default, and smoke.sh
# asserts a dotfile comes back from a listing.
#
# Symlinks out of the tree no longer mean anything special now that the root is /,
# but filebrowser stays pinned to a version with `followExternalSymlinks` and the
# flag is still passed explicitly.
#
# Config from airlock.toml ([apps.fileview]). Honors AIRLOCK_DRY_RUN=1.

  #                  that from outside our code, so state it.
  #   perm.share   — false. Share links are served at /api/public/* and /share/*
  #                  WITHOUT authentication once a share exists. Nothing proxies
  #                  those paths, but that is one wildcard include away from being
  #                  wrong, and turning the permission off costs one command.
  #   type detection — off. The unit already passes the flag and the flag wins

# ledger has markwand committed, the rename is handled for us: the package is gone
# from apps/, so `airlock-ledger plan` marks it `remove` and replays its recorded
# deactivator and artifact list before this installer ever runs. The hole is the
# box that predates the ledger — F15's sweep only recognises KNOWN builtins, and
# that list is derived from the shipped app directories, so renaming the directory
# makes `markwand` unknown and its leftovers invisible rather than reported.
#
# Rather than take a census of which boxes are pre-ledger, remove the four names
# unconditionally. Where the ledger already did it, every line below is a no-op.
# They are named literally — no globs — so this cannot reach anything else.
