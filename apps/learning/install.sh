#   browser --> hub (tailscale serve :443) --(identity)--> hub nginx
#     /learning/  -> learning backend 127.0.0.1:BACKEND (loopback only)

# The hub gate ($hub_ok) is asserted ONCE at the server level, so this location
# inherits it. The backend binds loopback, so the gate is the only route in.

# What this installer does NOT own: the library folder. It creates it if missing
# and never writes into it — the documents are the user's, produced by ingest and
# edited by them. Deactivating the app leaves the folder exactly as it is.
