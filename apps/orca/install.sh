#
#   browser --https--> tailscale serve :https_port --(identity)--> nginx owner-gate
#           --(owner only / else 403)--> orca serve 0.0.0.0:backend_port
#                                        (nft loopback-only: only the gate reaches it)
#
# Serves the PATCHED web client vendored at apps/orca/web-bundle/dist/ (PTY-reload
# fix + runtime-rebind, so terminals survive reload) at /orca-web/, and 302-redirects
# the vendor client URL to it. Owner document navigation to the bare root is redirected
# to the patched client carrying the pairing (zero-paste); a WebSocket upgrade to / is
# proxied to the runtime. If the bundle is absent it falls back to the raw upstream
# client. Provenance: apps/orca/web-bundle/README.md; attribution: repo-root NOTICE.
#
# Config from airlock.toml ([apps.orca]). Honors AIRLOCK_DRY_RUN=1: every system
# mutation (download, apt, systemctl, nft, tailscale, sudo) prints "[dry] ..."
# instead of running. The nginx fragment is config, not a mutation — always written.
#
# Pilot findings encoded below (each cost real debugging; do NOT "simplify" away):
# - orca serve has no --host flag, so it binds 0.0.0.0 -> nft loopback-only.
# - Under systemd --user the AppImage FUSE mount fails -> --appimage-extract + APPDIR.
# - orca is Electron (Chromium): even headless `serve` needs GTK libs + an X display
#   (no GTK -> 'libgtk-3.so.0' status 127; no display -> 'Missing X server' SIGSEGV).
# - The pairing URL is only ever written to serve.log, never to journald.
# - The orca daemon self-detaches into an app-orca-*.scope (app.slice), so the
#   service's own KillMode/MemoryMax never reach it -> ExecStopPost reap.
