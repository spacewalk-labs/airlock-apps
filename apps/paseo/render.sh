# apps/paseo/render.sh — sourceable render library (child 4, P1a
# extract-verify-swap). Functions only, no top-level execution. Each
# heredoc-bearing function body is a VERBATIM copy of the heredoc it
# replaces, proven byte-identical to the inline text by
# install/test-render-parity.sh before any write site moves (P1b).
#
# render_paseo_nginx composes the smaller pieces exactly as install.sh's
# fragment-assembly block does (same marker-splice order via sed -i on a
# scratch file) — a procedural copy of the splicing logic, since the
# original assembly is several heredocs plus shell logic, not one heredoc.

# HOME is a local (shadows $HOME for this function only — pops on return) so
# the heredoc body below can reference ${HOME} exactly as the source does.
# PY/PID_GUARD: interpreter + apps/paseo/paseo-clear-stale-pid.py path, spliced
# into an ExecStartPre that reaps a stale $HOME/.paseo/paseo.pid before start
# (see that script's header for why: upstream never reaps it itself).
# MEMMAX/MEMHIGH/TASKSMAX: explicit resource profile selected from the guest's
# effective memory by install.sh. Passed in rather than computed here so the
# rendered text stays a pure function of its arguments.
# NNP_BLOCK: normally the single line `NoNewPrivileges=yes`. When the installer
# has been told to proceed on a snap-wrapped node it is that line turned off plus
# the comment saying why — assembled by the caller and passed as ONE argument, on
# purpose. This heredoc is unquoted, and the reason text quotes a shell command;
# a value substituted into a heredoc is not re-scanned for substitution, so the
# text arrives literally no matter what it contains. Building it here instead
# would put operator-facing prose back inside the heredoc, which is exactly the
# shape that deleted three words from this unit on 2026-08-07.

Description=airlock-paseo — Paseo daemon (coding-agent orchestration + web UI) behind the owner gate
Documentation=https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo
# NOT After=default.target: this unit is WantedBy=default.target below, and a
# unit that is both Wanted by a target and ordered After that SAME target is a
# guaranteed ordering cycle (the target gets an implicit After= on everything
# it Wants — systemd.unit(5) "Default Dependencies" — so default.target ends
# up After= this unit AND this unit After= default.target). Measured on a real
# box: "Found ordering cycle on default.target/start ... Job
# airlock-paseo-browse-host.service/start deleted to break ordering cycle" —
# the unit never started on boot, only via a manual 'systemctl start'.
# network.target matches every other app unit in this repo (dev-monitor,
# devterm, feedback, publish, code-server) and carries no such back-edge.

# Reap a stale singleton pidfile before every start (including on-boot and every

# reboot (stale pid, sometimes already reused by an unrelated process) makes the
# daemon refuse to start FOREVER with "Another Paseo daemon is already running" —
# measured on a real box, RestartSec=3 looping it (counter into double digits).
# Leading '-': a guard-script problem must never block the real ExecStart; the
# script itself only ever deletes the file when it can prove staleness (dead pid,
# or a live pid whose uid/hostname/start-time contradict the record) and always
# exits 0 either way. See apps/paseo/paseo-clear-stale-pid.py.

# that exits the worker cleanly (status 0) and expects a supervisor to bring it back.
# Under on-failure systemd reads that as an intended stop and leaves it dead — so the
# button permanently kills the daemon (the gate stays up, so it just looks hung).
# An explicit 'systemctl --user stop' still stops it: always only covers self-exit.
# (Single quotes, not backticks: this heredoc is unquoted, so backticks here would
# be command substitution — the comment would RUN at install time and vanish.)

# Backstop, not a reservation (idle ~440M). The installer selects a measured
# profile from the guest's effective memory: 7–<16GiB gets 6.5G / 6G; 16GiB+
# gets 14G / 12G. A runaway multi-session tree cannot take the guest down with it.
#
# MemoryHigh is the part that matters in practice. MemoryMax alone is a cliff:
# the cgroup runs flat out to the ceiling and then the allocation is
# refused, and each runtime dies its own way there (node=SIGABRT, chrome=SIGTRAP,
# python=SIGSEGV) with no warning first. MemoryHigh does not refuse — it forces
# reclaim and throttles, so the result is a slowdown instead of a crash, and the
# 'high' counter in memory.events becomes an early signal. Measured on a box that
# had max but no high: high 1,886,403 / max 27,479 / oom_kill 0 — the kernel never
# killed anything, the sessions just got strangled and timed out. Read the counters
# with: cat /sys/fs/cgroup/user.slice/user-\$(id -u).slice/user@\$(id -u).service/\\
#       app.slice/airlock-paseo.service/memory.events
# 'high' climbing is by design; 'max' climbing means the box is too small.
# Keep high < max — above max it is inert.
MemoryMax=${MEMMAX}
MemoryHigh=${MEMHIGH}
# Agent trees fork wide (a CLI plus its children per session, times N sessions).
# 1024 was a real ceiling on a busy box: pids.events 'max' climbs, fork() starts
# failing, and it surfaces as unrelated-looking tool errors rather than as a
# resource limit. 24576 was the next guess, chosen on one box.
#
# 24,576 is deliberately generous: wide agent trees need far more than the old
# 1,024 ceiling, but the unit still records pids.events before a runaway tree can
# exhaust the enclosing user slice. AIRLOCK_PASEO_TASKS_MAX sets a different
# value only for a specifically measured host.
